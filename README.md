Description:
The basic idea behind the execution of the project is to save the time required to open the same files/folders/programmes (in the same sequences) everyday.
This is an attempt to automate the process so as to reduce keyboard and mouse commands by the user.

The .py scripts are automatically generated and are saved automatically.Custom Keybinds can then be assigned to these scripts.
For any furthur reference refer to the example files.
